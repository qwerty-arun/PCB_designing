- [usb connector](https://www.lcsc.com/product-detail/span-style-background-color-ff0-USB-span-Connectors_MOLEX-1050170001_C136000.html).
- Diodes:LESD5D5.0CT1G
- Transistors: SS8050-G
- Choose manufactures such that they have more parts in stock.
- Switches: Tactile switches: C&K: smd,6x6 : PTS645SL13SMTR92LFS
- Capacitors: Multilayer Ceramic Capacitors: Samsung: 0402: 10nF: Basic Part
- Often values in the schematics might be wrong, so do check the datasheet to see what manufacturers recommend. This is a good way to make sure you don't design the circuit the wrong way.
- Resistors: Chip Resistors: uni-royal : 0402
- You can copy the manufacturer no and paste it in the library, change the numbers and get a part of different value.
- 5.1k seems to be good enough for enough current to pass through LED.
- Basic parts are cheaper for assembly.
- If snap mode is off for some reason, turn it on immediately.
- Labelling all the pins of the ESP32 Board done.
- NC: No connection.
- NF: Not fitted (my convention).
- For labels too, make it a habit that you mention what voltages you will be using.
- What are decoupling capacitors?
- Just in case you need some filtering, add a capacitor.
- Refer to datasheets for types of pins, they may be I, O or even I/O. So make sure you always cross check. Sometimes, it won't be mentioned in schematics.
- Using jumpers, pin headers. Why though? So that we get direct supply of external 5V.
