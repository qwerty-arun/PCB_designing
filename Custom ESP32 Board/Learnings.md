- [usb connector](https://www.lcsc.com/product-detail/span-style-background-color-ff0-USB-span-Connectors_MOLEX-1050170001_C136000.html).
- Diodes:LESD5D5.0CT1G
- Transistors: SS8050-G
- Choose manufactures such that they have more parts in stock.
- Switches: Tactile switches: C&K: smd,6x6 : PTS645SL13SMTR92LFS
- Capacitors: Multilayer Ceramic Capacitors: Samsung: 0402: 10nF: Basic Part
- Often values in the schematics might be wrong, so do check the datasheet to see what manufacturers recommend. This is a good way to make sure you don't design the circuit the wrong way.
- Resistors: Chip Resistors: uni-royal : 0402
- You can copy the manufacturer no and paste it in the library, change the numbers and get a part of different value.
- 5.1k seems to be good enough for enough current to pass through LED.
- Basic parts are cheaper for assembly.
- If snap mode is off for some reason, turn it on immediately.
- Labelling all the pins of the ESP32 Board done.
- NC: No connection.
- NF: Not fitted (my convention).
- For labels too, make it a habit that you mention what voltages you will be using.
- What are decoupling capacitors?
- Just in case you need some filtering, add a capacitor.
- Refer to datasheets for types of pins, they may be I, O or even I/O. So make sure you always cross check. Sometimes, it won't be mentioned in schematics.
- Using jumpers, pin headers. Why though? So that we get direct supply of external 5V.
- The whole point of the pin header is to make it easy to switch bewteen different power supplies using a jumper.
- Adding a small resistance -> Series termination, it can be helpful to minimise reflections and improve quality of signal. The reason is, in our application, the signal is splitting to different places.
- Idea of filtering the power source.
- Comparision of ESP32 with S2 reference schematic.
- [cp2102n errata: problem with silicon](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/errata/cp2102n-errata.pdf)
- Addition of transistors.
- We added a 2 pin header, it won't be fitted but can be used for short circuiting and use this circuit by ourselves manually by adding a GPIO23 pin.
- Adding titles to each circuit block makes the schematic a lot more professional.
- Reset annotations, add annotations to some parts manually. Then keep the existing annotations and then annotate other parts so that we don't need to annotate manually.
- Place the not connected flags on the pins that you don't use.
- You will get multiple errors saying that a wire has multiple net labels. How to fix that? Well, I just went ahead with PCB designing.
## PCB Designing
- You can change the board outline however you want. Starting point: x=1000, y=1000, width=2500, height=800.
- Units changed to mil.
- 100 mil grid size and snap size of 5.
- Parts being placed on bottom layer: header pins.
- ESP module placed on the top layer.
- You can measure the distance between parts too, so that you make sure you have placed the parts correctly.
- While watching any tutorial, make sure you see X-position and Y-position, not the mouse position. Because the X and Y positions refer to the centre of the part and its easier to refer to it.
- USB to UART chip's pin 1 to be on the bottom right corner.
- Cross probe and place directly on to the PCB, so that you don't waste time finding the part.
- Know where parts are placed in the schematic, similary place the components on the PCB. Ex: A capacitor is connected a voltage source in the schematic, so place that capacitor near the voltage pin.
- Two labels of the resistors which I placed have the labels (gnd and gnd) on them. Even though the connections are proper in the schematic, why is it like this? Is is wrong?
- For 5_ext volts external supply, it is correct, but for 3V it is wrong. Is +3V3 shorted somewhere?
- Well, you need to update PCB in desgin tab. Only then changes will be reflected on to the PCB. Only saving files won't work.
- No space on the top layer? Place on the bottom layer and close to where the part is connected.
- No stubs: It helps the quality of the signal
- While editing in bottom layer, the parts should also be in bottom layer configuration. Just remember this, or else you will end up placing the part on top layer.
